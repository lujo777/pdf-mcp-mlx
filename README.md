**Surgical PDF access for AI agents — search, read, and extract without flooding context.**

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server that enables AI agents to read, search, and extract content from PDF files. Built with Python and PyMuPDF, with SQLite-based caching for persistence across server restarts.

**mcp-name: io.github.jztan/pdf-mcp**

## Try it in your browser

**[See what your AI agent sees →](https://pdf-mcp.jztan.com/)**

Drop in any PDF and watch an agent skim it, search it, and read only the pages that matter — using a fraction of the tokens. 100% client-side, no install required.

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jztan/pdf-mcp/develop/docs/images/demo.gif" alt="pdf-mcp browser demo: an AI agent maps a 216-page PDF, searches it, and reads only the matching pages — using a fraction of the tokens" width="760">](https://pdf-mcp.jztan.com/)

## Why pdf-mcp?

| | Without pdf-mcp | With pdf-mcp |
|---|---|---|
| Large PDFs | Context overflow | Chunked reading |
| Token budgeting | Guess and overflow | Estimated tokens before reading |
| Finding content | Load everything | Hybrid search — RRF fusion of BM25 keyword (FTS5) + semantic embeddings; never misses what either alone would |
| Tables | Lost in raw text | Extracted and inlined per page |
| Multi-column PDFs | Columns interleaved in extracted text | Column-aware reading order (`pdf-mcp[multicolumn]`) |
| Images | Ignored | Extracted as PNG files |
| Repeated access | Re-parse every time | SQLite cache |
| Scanned PDFs | No text extracted | OCR via Tesseract (`pdf_read_pages(ocr=True)`) |
| Visual content | Must describe in words | Render page as image (`pdf_render_pages`) |
| Tool design | Single monolithic tool | 9 specialized tools |

## Features

Give your agent surgical access to PDFs instead of flooding context with raw text.

- **Hybrid search** — find relevant pages with a question, not a page range. Combines BM25 keyword and semantic search via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **Paginated reading** — fetch only the pages your agent needs; large documents don't blow your context window
- **OCR** — scanned and image-based PDFs are fully readable and searchable via Tesseract
- **Structured extraction** — tables, embedded images, and table of contents returned as structured data, not text soup
- **Persistent cache** — SQLite-backed; re-reads are instant and survive server restarts
- **Secure URL fetching** — HTTPS-only with SSRF protection; local network ranges are blocked

## Installation

```bash
pip install pdf-mcp
```

For semantic search (adds `fastembed` and `numpy`, ~67 MB model download on first use):

```bash
pip install 'pdf-mcp[semantic]'
```

For correct reading order on multi-column PDFs (adds `pymupdf4llm`, which pulls `pymupdf_layout`/`onnxruntime`):

```bash
pip install 'pdf-mcp[multicolumn]'
```

Without it, multi-column pages fall back to positional-sort extraction, which can interleave columns.

For OCR on scanned PDFs (requires system Tesseract):

```bash
# macOS
brew install tesseract

# Ubuntu/Debian
apt install tesseract-ocr

# Windows — download the installer from:
# https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
# Then add the install directory to your PATH.
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
pdf-mcp --help
```

## Tools

Nine specialized tools cover document introspection, content reading, search, cache management, and server feature discovery. The typical pattern: call `pdf_info` first to plan, then `pdf_search` to locate — its paragraph excerpts are often enough to answer directly. Use `pdf_read_pages` or `pdf_read_all` when you need deeper context.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pdf_info` | Page count, metadata, TOC summary, scanned-page detection. **Call first.** |
| `pdf_get_toc` | Full table of contents for documents with >50 bookmarks |
| `pdf_read_pages` | Read specific pages or ranges; OCR-on-demand; embedded images + tables |
| `pdf_read_all` | Read entire document in one call (byte-capped for safety) |
| `pdf_render_pages` | Render pages as PNG for vision models — diagrams, handwriting, scans |
| `pdf_search` | Hybrid RRF search (keyword + semantic), page or section granularity, optional paragraph excerpts |
| `pdf_cache_stats` | Per-document cache breakdown + total size |
| `pdf_cache_clear` | Clear expired or all cache entries |
| `server_info` | Which optional features (column-aware, OCR, semantic) and config are active. **Call before feature-dependent calls.** |

Example prompts:

```
"Read the PDF at /path/to/document.pdf"
"Which pages discuss supply chain risks?"
"Find sections about the training process"
"Show me what page 5 looks like"
"OCR pages 3-5 of the scanned PDF"
```

See **[docs/tool-reference.md](docs/tool-reference.md)** for the complete reference — every parameter, response shape, security contract, and example. For semantic-search model selection, see **[docs/embedding-models.md](docs/embedding-models.md)**.

## Example Workflow

For a large document (e.g., a 200-page annual report):

```
User: "Summarize the risk factors in this annual report"

Agent workflow:
1. pdf_info("report.pdf")
   → 200 pages, TOC shows "Risk Factors" on page 89

2. pdf_search("report.pdf", "risk factors")
   → Matches with structural paragraph excerpts — each excerpt
     is the bullet, paragraph, or heading that matched, not a
     fixed-width window. Often enough to answer directly.

3. If excerpts are sufficient → synthesize answer

4. If more context needed:
   pdf_read_pages("report.pdf", "89-95")
   → Full page text for deeper reading
```

## Configuration

### Access control (optional)

Create `~/.config/pdf-mcp/config.toml` to restrict which local paths and URL hosts the server will access. The file is optional — if absent, the server is permissive within the built-in SSRF floor (HTTPS-only, blocked private IP ranges).

```toml
[paths]
allow = ["~/Documents/**", "/data/pdfs/**"]
deny  = ["~/.ssh/**", "~/.aws/**"]

[urls]
allow = ["*.internal.example.com"]
deny  = ["untrusted.example.com"]

[limits]
max_response_bytes = 200000
```

The `[limits]` block caps text-payload byte size on `pdf_read_all` and section-granularity `pdf_search` — see [docs/response-limits.md](docs/response-limits.md). Rules use shell-glob patterns (`*` matches across path separators). `deny` wins when both match. Path matching operates on the resolved path after symlink expansion. A malformed config file prevents the server from starting — it never silently falls back to permissive.

### Environment variables

```bash
# Cache directory (default: ~/.cache/pdf-mcp)
PDF_MCP_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache

# Cache TTL in hours (default: 24)
PDF_MCP_CACHE_TTL=48

# Max worker processes for parallel OCR / rendering in pdf_read_pages
# (default: auto = min(cpu_count, pages, 8)). Set to 1 to force sequential.
PDF_MCP_MAX_WORKERS=8
```

### Caching

The server uses SQLite for persistent caching. This is necessary because MCP servers using STDIO transport are spawned as a new process for each conversation.

**Cache location:** `~/.cache/pdf-mcp/cache.db`

**What's cached:**

| Data | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| Metadata + text coverage | Avoid re-parsing document info |
| Page text | Skip re-extraction |
| Images | Skip re-encoding |
| Tables | Skip re-detection |
| TOC | Skip re-parsing |
| FTS5 index | O(log N) search with BM25 ranking after first query |
| Embeddings | Instant semantic search after first indexing run |
| Rendered PNGs | Skip re-rendering; shared between `pdf_render_pages` and `pdf_read_pages(render_dpi=…)` |

**Cache invalidation:**
- Automatic when file modification time changes
- Manual via the `pdf_cache_clear` tool
- TTL: 24 hours (configurable)
